# ObjectStore

## Introduction
This application needs flexible and scalable storage space. SURF has it's own storage service for these type of applications called SURF Object Store

## Integration
At the moment of implementing the SURF Object Store uses an OpenStack Object Storage. It was decided to use a package to interact with the storage.
